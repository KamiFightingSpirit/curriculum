<h1>Cuteness TV</h1>
<br>
                
 <p id="recipePage">
Goal: Make a GUI program using Swing in a Model-View-Controller design architecture.<br><br>
The program will have a window (frame) with a number of buttons that will show different videos when clicked.
</p><br>                 
                
                
                
                
<ol id="recipePage">
    
    <li>You will need FOUR classes to complete this program as follows:<br>
   <br>     
    
        <ul>
            <li><h4>a Model</h4> that will have the video links. Use the code below for the cutest videos ever. <br>
<pre>
String ducks = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q";
String frog ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBkWhkAZ9ds";
String unicorns = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-xWhG4UU_Y"; 
</pre>
                <br>
              
Note: If any of these video links no longer work, go to youtube and get replacements. Use the String names to give you a hint about what the videos contain
       
            </li>
            
            <li><h4>a View</h4> that will have a frame, a panel, and 3 buttons. NOTE: because this GUI has more than one button, you must add a JPanel to your JFrame and put the buttons on the panel! The View will need to have a variable for the controller (because it will need a mouse listener).</li>
            
            <li><h4>a Controller</h4> that is a mouse listener so it can process button presses. The controller acts as the go-between so needs to have variabels for the view and model. Use the code below to play the videos:
            
            
<pre>
     void playVideo(String videoID) { 
     try {
        URI uri = new URI(videoID);
        java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop().browse(uri);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
</pre>            
            
            
            </li>
            
            <li><h4>a Runner</h4> that will contain the main method and create the View object at the start of the program</li>
        </ul>    
        If you need help to get started, take a look at the previous recipes that you already completed in this module.<br>
        </li>
                </ol>                
                

   <li>
    
  

    </li>     

         </ol>   
    </div>
    </div>                
                
<div id="footer">
