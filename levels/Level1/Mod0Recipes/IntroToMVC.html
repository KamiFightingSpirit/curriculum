                    <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
<p id="recipePage">
"Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time."</p>
    <br>
                    <h3>Model-View-Controller Pattern</h3>
    
 <p id="recipePage">   
One of the design patterns is called Model-View-Controller (known as MVC). The MVC pattern was developed to separate a program's components to allow for reusability. By separating the data (Model) from how it is seen (View), the same data can be used in many different ways. The Controller acts as a go-between, to help manage the flow of information between the View and Model.</p>
<br>
                    <h3>What is the View?</h3>
<p id="recipePage">           
The View represents what we can see. This is often referred to as a Graphical User Interface or GUI. In our recipes, we will use Java Swing Components, such as JFrame, JPanel, and JButton to help us build a View.<br>
</p>
    <br>
                
                       <h3>What is the Controller?</h3>
<p id="recipePage"> 
The Controller communicates updates whenever something changes. Changes can occur as a result of user actions or changes in data. In our Swing-based recipes we will use Listeners and Adaptors as Controller objects to allow users to interact with Views. Sometimes the same Controller can be used for different Views, but more often each View will need its own dedicated Controller.
</p>
<br>

                <h3>What is the Model?</h3>
<p id="recipePage">
The Model represents the data (objects) on which the program is based. The model will have no knowledge of Views or Controllers. In fact, the same Model might be associated with a variety of different Views. However, the Controller can cause the date in a Model to be changed when the program runs.
