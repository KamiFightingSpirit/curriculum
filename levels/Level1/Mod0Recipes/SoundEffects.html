<h1>Sound Effects Machine</h1>
<br>
                
<p id="recipePage">
Goal: Make a GUI program using Swing in a Model-View-Controller design architecture.<br><br>
The program will have a window (frame) with a number of buttons that will play different sound effects when clicked.

    <li>Create a GUI for a sound effects machine that will play the different sounds (see above) when buttons are pressed. You will need FOUR classes to complete this program as follows:<br>
   <br>     
    
        <ul>
            <li><h4>a Model</h4> that will have the sound effects (see the Drum Kit recipe for setting up sound (AudioClip) objects).<br>
            <br>
             Gather sound bites for your sound effects machine. <u>They must be .wav files.</u> Free sound effects can be found <a href="http://soundbible.com/free-sound-effects-1.html">here</a>. The League also has an account at <a href="https://freesound.org/">freesound</a>. Ask your teacher for our login.<br><br>
            The .wav files must be <u>placed into your sound effects recipe package</u> (drag and drop).</li>
    
            <li><h4>a View</h4> that will have a frame, a panel, and buttons. NOTE: because this GUI has more than one button, you must add a JPanel to your JFrame and put the buttons on the panel! The View will need to have a variable for the controller (because it will need a mouse listener).</li>
            <li><h4>a Controller</h4> that is a mouse listener so it can process button presses. The controller acts as the go-between so needs to have variables for the view and model</li>
            <li><h4>a Runner</h4> that will contain the main method and create the View object at the start of the program</li>
        </ul>    
        If you need help to get started, take a look at the previous recipes that you already completed in this module. Drum Kit is a good one to look at since it also plays sound files and will have a lot of methods you can use.<br>
