<h1>Sound Effects Machine</h1>
<br>
                
<p id="recipePage">
Goal: Make a program that uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) design architecture.
<br><br>
This program will have a window (frame) with a number of buttons that will play different sound effects when clicked.
</p><br>

        If you need help with any of these steps, take a look at the previous recipes in this module.<br> <br> 
    
      <h4>Complete the Model</h4><br>  
    <li>A sample sound effect (drum) has been provided. Add some more of your own here.<br>
    <br>
     <u>They must be .wav files.</u> Free sound effects can be found <a href="http://soundbible.com/free-sound-effects-1.html">here</a>. The League also has an account at <a href="https://freesound.org/">freesound</a>. Ask your teacher for our login.<br><br>
    The .wav files must be placed into your <font color="green">sound_effects_machine</font> package (drag and drop).</li>

    
    
    
    
      <h4>Make the View</h4><br>  
       <li>Find the SoundEffects class in the <font color="green">sound_effects_machine</font> package. Complete the makeFrame() method to create a frame, a panel, and a button for each sound effect in your machine. NOTE: you must add a JPanel to your JFrame because there will be more than one button! Make a variable for the controller (which will be a MouseListener).</li>
    
     <h4>Runner</h4><br>         
    <li>Run the SoundEffectsRunner class (has a main method). Make sure it is showing your frame with buttons before proceeding.</li> 

    
    
    
    
    <h4>Connect a Controller</h4><br>          
      <li>Find the SoundEffectsController class. Make it a MouseListener so it can process mouse clicks.</li>            
       <li>Create and initialize variables for the view and model objects where shown.</li>      
     <li>If you successsfully made it a MouseListener, there should be a mouseClicked method. Add code to this method for each of the buttons on the view. Hint: use the button text to figure out which one was clicked</li>
    <li>Call the method on the Model that will return the sound (AudioClip) you want, then tell the AudioClip to play.</li>
       <li>Run the SoundEffectsRunner and check that each of the buttons plays the right sound.</li>
