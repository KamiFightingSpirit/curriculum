                    <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
<p id="recipePage">
"Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time."</p>
    <br>
                    <h3>Model-View-Controller Pattern</h3>
    
 <p id="recipePage">   
One such pattern is the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern (known as MVC). The MVC pattern was developed to separate a program's components and allows for object reusability. By separating the data (Model) from how it is viewed (View), the same data can be viewed or used in many different ways. The Controller acts as a go-between, to manage the flow of information between the View and Model.</p>
<br>
                    <h3>What is the View?</h3>
<p id="recipePage">                
The View represents what we can see. In our recipes, we will use Java Swing objects to help us build a View. Java Swing is a set of classes that are designed to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs.<br>
                </p>
                       <h3>What is the Controller?</h3>
<p id="recipePage"> 
The Controller communicates updates to each of the program's components whenever something changes. Changes can occur as a result of user actions or changes in data. In our recipes we will use Listeners and Adaptors to indicate which GUI components generate program changes.
