<h1>Chuckle Clicker</h1>
<br>
                
 <p id="recipePage">
Goal: Make a GUI program using Swing in a Model-View-Controller design architecture.<br><br>
The program will have 2 buttons. One says “Joke” the other says “Punchline”. When the user clicks on the Joke button, they will see a joke. When they click Punchline, they will see the punchline.
</p><br>
                
<ol id="recipePage">
        If you need help with any of these steps, take a look at the MVC recipes you completed in Module 0.<br> <br>
      All the classes for this program should be created in the <font color="green">chuckle_clicker</font> package.<br> <br> You will need to create FOUR classes to complete this program. <u>If you create all the classes before you start coding, it is easier to code and test each part as you go. </u> <br>
   <br>                     
                
        <ul>

             <li><h4>a Model</h4> <br>The model needs two String member variables for a joke and a punchline.<br>
                It will also need two public methods. One that returns the joke, the other the punchline.<br>
            </li>
            
          
            <li><h4>a View</h4><br> 
                The View object needs a member variable to hold a controller because it will need a MouseListener to be added to the buttons.<br>
                <br>

                Place code to build a frame into a method (makeFrame). The View will need 2 buttons, and a label. NOTE: because this GUI has more than one component, you must put the buttons and label onto a JPanel, then add the panel to the JFrame. 
                <br><br>
                Remember to set the frame to be visible, to exit on close, and to pack itself around the components to be the right size. You must add a MouseListener (the controller) to each of the buttons.<br> 
                <br>    
                Make a constructor for this class. In the constructor, first initialize the controller member variable. Next, call the method you wrote to make the frame.<br><br>
                
                Code a public method that will set text into the View's label. 
 
            <br>
            
            <li><h4>a Controller</h4> <br>This class must implement MouseListener methods so it can process mouse clicks. 
            <br><br>    
            It also needs member variables for the view and model. 
            <br><br>
            Make a constructor for this class. The constructor will initialize the the model variable (call the model's constructor). It must get a view object as a parameter and use that to initialize its view variable (check the view class to make sure it is passing itself to this controller).
            <br><br>    
            In the mouseClicked method, check which button was clicked (getSource). Get the text from the model (joke or punchline) and pass it to the view to set the text on its label.
            </li>
            
            <li><h4>a Runner</h4> <br>This class should contain a main method that creates a View object to start the program. You will need this object to test the rest of your code.</li>
                     
            <li><h4>Now run the program to test it</h4></li>
        </ul>    

     

                </ol>
