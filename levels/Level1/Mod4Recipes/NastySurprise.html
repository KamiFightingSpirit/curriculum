<h1>Nasty Surprise</h1>
<br>
                    
<p id="recipePage">
Goal: Make a program that uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) design architecture.
<br><br>
This program will have a window (frame) with 2 buttons. One says “Trick” the other says “Treat”. When the user clicks on the Trick button, they will see a picture of a cute puppy. When they click Treat, they will see a scary image.
</p><br> 

                
<ol id="recipePage">
    If you need help with any of these steps, take a look at the MVC recipes in Module 0<br><br> 
    All the classes for this program should be created in the <font color="green">nasty_surprise</font> package.<br> <br> Create FOUR classes to complete this program. <u>If you create all the classes before you start coding, it is easier to code and test each part as you go. </u> <br>  <br> 
<ul>
    
    <h4>Make the Model</h4> <br>
     <li>Create a class for the Model. </li>  
    <li>Add two String variables that are initialized to the Internet addresses of two pictures (use a browser to find images, and "copy image address").</li>
    <li>Create two public methods. One that returns the puppy Icon, and another that returns the scary Icon.  Here is some code you can use to make an Icon (image) from an Internet address (String).<br>
                
<pre>   private Icon getPictureFromTheInternet(String imageUrl) {
        Icon icon = null;
        try {
            URL url = new URL(imageUrl);
            icon = new ImageIcon(url);
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return icon;
    }</pre>
                <br>  
            </li>    
   
      <h4>Make the View</h4><br> 
            <li>
        Create a class for the View.</li>

    <li>
    Add a method that will make the View. It should create a frame, a panel, two buttons ("trick" and "treat") and a label (for the picture).
    
    Remember to set the frame to be visible, to exit on close, and to pack the frame so it will be the right size. </li> 

    <li>Add a member variable for the controller </li>  
    
    <li>Make a constructor for this class. In the constructor, initialize a controller member variable. Next, call the method you just wrote to make the frame.</li>


    <li>Make a public method that will change the picture shown on the label (setIcon). You will also need to pack the frame every time the picture changes in case it is a different size.</li>
    
    <h4>Make the Controller</h4><br> 
    <li>Create a class for the Controller. This class must implement MouseListener methods so it can process mouse clicks. </li>
    
    <li>Add member variables for a view and a model. </li>
    
    <li>Make a constructor for this class. The constructor will initialize the the model variable (call the model's constructor). It must get a view object as a parameter and use that to initialize its view variable (check the view class to make sure it is passing itself to this controller).
    </li>   
    <li>In the mouseClicked method, check which button was clicked (getSource). Get the right picture from the model (trick or treat) based on which button was pressed, and send it to change the picture.       
    </li>
    <li>Now you have finished the Controller, go back to the View and add a MouseListener (the controller) to each of its buttons.
    </li>            
                
    <h4>Make a Runner</h4><br>
        <li>
       Create a Runner class.</li>
     <li>This class should contain a main method that creates a View object to start the program. You will need this object to test the rest of your code.</li>
        
    <li><h4>Now run the program to test it</h4></li>
        
   </ul>
