<br>
    Instruct students to do the following - check student screens to monitor understanding.<br>
    <br>
    Help students who are stuck, but note lack of mastery.

   <li>Create an interface called Drawable</li>

   <li>Add a method called getFramerate that takes no parameters but returns an int.</li>
        					

     <li>Create a class called Animation2D. Make this class a subclass of Animation and make it implement Drawable.</li>

   <li>Override the draw method to simply print "drawing"</li>
        					
   <li>Override the getFramerate method to return 24.</li>
        					

  <li>Add a main method and create an Animation2D object.</li>
