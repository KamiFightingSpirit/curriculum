        	<h1>Abstract City</h1>
<p id="recipePage">Take a look at the given code along with the JUinit test. The abstract class City has been made for you.<br><br>
Your job is to make four (4) subclasses of the abstract City class. The classes will be SanDiego, Boston, LosAngeles, and Atlanta. <br><br>
You have to write the getAnnualTaxes method for each city. In this utopia, every citizen only has to pay the city one dollar per year in taxes. 
Therefore, the annual taxes can be calculated by multiplying the population by the growthRate. However, each city gets a unique bonus based
on the information below:</p>

<ol id="recipePage"> 
        			<li>San Diego gets a flat bonus of $1,000,000 for being the best city ever.</li>
<li>Boston gets a bonus of $0.50 per person for having wicked cool accents.</li>
<li>Los Angeles gets a multiplication bonus of half the growthRate from the Hollywood Mafia.</li>
<li>Atlanta gets a multiplication bonus of twice the growthRate because their airport is just so darn huge!
</li>
                </ol>
